# Cascading Bandits Ranking Pipeline (PySpark)

This project implements a **Cascading Multi-Armed Bandits** system for personalized product ranking and online learning using **PySpark + Delta Lake**.
All logic lives inside **`main.py`**.

---

## What This Project Does

* Re-ranks products for each user using **Linear UCB**
* Learns from real click events (cascade model)
* Updates product parameters (`A_I`, `b_i`) after every interaction
* Stores results in **Delta tables** for scalable, production-grade use

---

## Algorithm Summary (Linear UCB + Cascading Bandits)

### **Model Update**

For each product with feature vector **x** and reward **r**:

```
A_I = A_I + x x^T
b_i = b_i + r x
```

### **Parameter Estimation**

```
θ = A_I^-1 b_i
```

### **Scoring (Upper Confidence Bound)**

```
raw_score = θᵀ x
uncertainty = α √(xᵀ A_I^-1 x)
ucb_score = raw_score + uncertainty
```

### **Cascade Learning**

A clicked product receives:

* **reward = 1**
* All items shown **above** it receive **reward = 0**
* Items below it receive **no updates**

---

## Example Use Cases

### E-commerce personalization

Re-rank products in real time and learn from click-through behavior.

### Search result ranking

Boost results with exploration-driven scoring.

### Content recommendation

Rank videos, articles, or ads based on predicted engagement + uncertainty.

### Ad/slot optimization

Select the best item to show when space is limited.
